    <p>Today is April 1st, so it is the occasion to shine a light on a few fake RFCs made on that day.</p>

<p>The most famous of all is the experimental RFC1149 of 1990, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149">A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers</a>. 
As the title suggests, the authors specified an entire protocol to send IP packets using pigeons as physical layer.
The RFC has been updated and even tested in Norway.</p>

<p>There are a few others that made me laugh:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1605">RFC1605: SONET to Sonnet Translation by William Shakespear</a>: where SONNET means “SONET Over Novel English Translation”, a way to compress SONET’s 810 bytes frames into 14 lines of 90 bytes frames.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925">RFC1925: The Twelve Networking Truths</a>. 
 From this one I will only quote the following: 
 “With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them as they fly overhead.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2795">RFC2795: The Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite (IMPS)</a> describes practical issues of having an infinite number of monkeys typing randomly on an infinite number of keyboard to eventually write a copy of shakespear’s work.</li>
</ul>

<p>This reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZEBPddOj9c">a friend’s video</a> about the number (\pi)</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3251">RFC3251: Electricity over IP</a> which has a lot of cool accronyms in it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6921">RFC6921: Design Considerations for Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Communication</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wikipedia, from which all of these were found has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day_Request_for_Comments">nice list of April fool’s RFC</a> which I encourage you to take a look at.</p>
