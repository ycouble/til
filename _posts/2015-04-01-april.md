Today is April 1st, so it is the occasion to shine a light on a few fake RFCs made on that day.
  

The most famous of all is the experimental RFC1149 of 1990, [A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149). 
As the title suggests, the authors specified an entire protocol to send IP packets using pigeons as physical layer.
The RFC has been updated and even tested in Norway.

There are a few others that made me laugh:

* [RFC1605: SONET to Sonnet Translation by William Shakespear](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1605): where SONNET means "SONET Over Novel English Translation", a way to compress SONET's 810 bytes frames into 14 lines of 90 bytes frames.
* [RFC1925: The Twelve Networking Truths](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925). 
 From this one I will only quote the following: 
 "With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them as they fly overhead."
* [RFC2795: The Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite (IMPS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2795) describes practical issues of having an infinite number of monkeys typing randomly on an infinite number of keyboard to eventually write a copy of shakespear's work.
   

 This reminds me of [a friend's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZEBPddOj9c) about the number \(\pi\)
* [RFC3251: Electricity over IP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3251) which has a lot of cool accronyms in it.
* [RFC6921: Design Considerations for Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Communication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6921).

Wikipedia, from which all of these were found has a [nice list of April fool's RFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day_Request_for_Comments) which I encourage you to take a look at.
