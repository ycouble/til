       "719  I’ve been trying to do some basic keyword extraction and finding it harder than expected.\\nKeyBERT seems good but it requires a powerful GPU to be usably fast. That’s possible with AWS, but there’s a bit more set up.\\nI just tried PyTextRank, and I was surprised at the quality of the output - I wouldn’t say it was perfect either. Maybe I should set a threshold, like choose the top _NUMBER_ ranked keywords? It’s fine if we exclude potential good keywords just to have a smaller list of good ones.\\nHere’s a good article about _NUMBER_ different methods, which is helpful -\\n_URL_\\nIn theory, Spacy and BERT seem like the best options but they’re both a little complex. \\nI think KW extraction really only needs a few layers or as Spacy would call them pipelines.\\n_NUMBER_. accurate tokenization of words and punctuation symbols\\n_NUMBER_. accurate recognition of multi-word expressions  - think of it as “chunking”\\n_NUMBER_. Strong assessment of keyword “candidacy” for each MWE \\nOf course, a good algorithm can often skip steps. Like BERT is so smart it doesn’t need anything but the input text.\\nDoes anyone know of a simplest way to run a fast, effective keyword extraction?\\nI’m talking _NUMBER_ keywords in one second on a fast CPU.\\nThanks very much   \n",
