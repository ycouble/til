This site contains my TIL (Today I Learnt) notes, which are sometimes a handful of python lines that I found useful, some other times notes on a course or video that I liked, and sometime more insightful posts about something I work on at the moment.

There is no unique theme to this website, as is my journey in technology.
The earliest posts precede my PhD and at that moment I was interested in communication protocols and space exploration.
More recently and in the near future, this blog will host my posts on python, data science and more importantly Natural Language Processing, which is at the core of my current job.
