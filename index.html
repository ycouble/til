This site contains my TIL (Today I Learnt) notes, which are sometimes a handful of python lines that I found useful, some other times notes on a course or video that I liked, and sometime more insightful posts about something I work on at the moment :).

There is no common theme as is my journey in technology, from telecoms and networks to data science to natural language processing.
